This repositry containts three files, each one concerning three different data structures or algorithms and operations to perform in/with them:
1) linked_list: sum_lastN() returns the sum of the last N digits of a linked list, insert_middle() inserts an element in the middle of a linked list, insert_list() inserts a list inside a linked list, reverseK reverses elements on the list in groups of K and maximum_pair, which returns the maximum sum of any two consecutive elements in the list.
2) binary_search_tree: allows to perform different operations on a binary search tree such as inserting and removing while keeping the balance.
3) dijkstra: min_number_edges(start, end) returns the minimum number of edges from start to end, min_distance(distances, visited) returns the vertex whose distance is lower, transpose() returns a new graph that is the transpose of itself, is_strongly_connected() checks if the graph is strongly connected and bfs() performs a breadth-first search.
