# Machine_Learning
These are all the projects I did for my Machine Learning course at uni:

handwritten_digit_classification_mlp: digit classification on the classic MNIST dataset using a Multi-Layer Perceptron.

handwritten_digit_classification_cnn: digit classification on the classic MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network.

sentiment_classification_rnn: sentiment classification on a preprocessed dataset consisting of 25,000 sentences about movie reviews using a Recurrent Neural Network, specifically, a LSTM.

pca: principal component analysis.

k-means_clustering: self-explanatory.

frozen_lake_mdp: reinforcement learning on a Deterministic-4x4-FrozenLake-v0 environment. The frozen lake involves crossing a frozen lake from start to goal without falling into any holes by walking over the
frozen lake. The player makes moves until they reach the goal or fall in a hole.
