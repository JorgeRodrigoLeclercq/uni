# Side-ChannelAttack_PowerConsumption
The different files on this repository simulate, step by step, an attack on an authentication system, implemented in an Assemby Language useable in MIPS-32, RISC-V architectures.
string_compare: compares two strings.
study_energy: checks the energy consumed by the function string_compare.
attack: performs a side-channel attack based on power consumption.
